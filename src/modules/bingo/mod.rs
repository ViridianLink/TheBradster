const YOUR_CARD: &str = "- Your bingo card is randomly generated.
- Below this message you'll see a 5x5 grid of clickable buttons.
- The center square is a FREE SPACE - you can click that button right away to mark it!";
const HOW_TO_PLAY: &str = "- As I stream, watch and listen carefully!
- Your bingo card is filled with specific actions I might do or phrases I'm likely to say.
- If you see me do an action or hear me say a phrase that matches one of the squares on your card, click the corresponding button on your card to mark it. It should turn green to show it's selected!";
const HOW_TO_WIN: &str = "- To win, you need to be the first to complete a winning pattern by clicking the correct buttons on your card.
- When your clicks complete a row, column, diagonal, or a full board, the bot will notify the Mod Team with your card to be verified.
- Once a Mod confirms your win, I'll announce you as the BINGO winner on stream! üì¢
- Incorrect BINGO will be discarded so, focus on accurately clicking your card!";
const NOTES: &str = "- Your card is randomly generated from a list of spaces created by the Mod team.
- Accurate Clicks Only: Please only click a square if the action/phrase has actually happened on stream. Mods will verify every BINGO!
- Prizes: Today's winner(s) will get {PRIZE_STR}! üèÜ
- Ties: If the bot detects multiple BINGOs from the same action/phrase simultaneously, the winner will be the first person the bot registered and sent to the mods.
- Your first click will highlight a square (aka a button) in blue. The second click will then lock it in ‚Äî that means the item has been confirmed and the button will turn green.
- Once a button is green, there's no going back ‚Äî if it's a false mark, your card will become null and void.
- Highlighting a button in blue can help you keep track ‚Äî for example, if Brad enters the third encounter and you know a square can only happen there, you can highlight it to help remember. It's also a safety feature to prevent misclicks.";
